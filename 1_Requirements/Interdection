# PASSWORD MANAGEMENT#
Passwords are a set of strings provided by users at the authentication prompts of web accounts.
Although passwords still remain as one of the most secure methods of authentication available to date,
they are subjected to a number of security threats when mishandled.
 The role of password management comes in handy there.
 Password management is a set of principles and best practices to be followed by 
 users while storing and managing passwords in an efficient manner to secure 
 passwords as much as they can to prevent unauthorized access.
